Today’s thought, ‘annena jātāni jivanti’, makes them curious. Mishti tells Medu that it is a Sanskrit saying which means ‘food gives life to living beings.’ Let us try to understand the significance of this saying. 3.1 What Do We Eat?

Although vitamins and minerals are required in small amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. What differences do you observe in raw and cooked vegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly washed before consumption. plaD n no u ts tw r aie ne n do b t ast n a fr ii mn om aa ll sl ? sN a so elt, a cM wae and t ebu re. oN o rbu ftt rar oii ne mn e dt rs o fl cri kok se m . Also, Vitamin D can be naturally produced by our body upon exposure to sunlight. Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see how dietary fibres are beneficial for us. In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage in our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. 46 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 3.indd 46 10/4/2024 3:19:56 PM 6 edarG | ecneicS fo koobtxeT | ytisoiruC",1583,Unknown,6,example,easy,12,0,fecu103.pdf,Science,to explore the functions

He analysed more than 500 Indian foods for their nutritional value and recommended an appropriate diet in the Indian context. He led surveys on the nutritional status of the Indian population, identifying widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, to provide balanced food in the government-run and government-aided schools of our country. This scheme has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of millions of children nationwide. 47 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 3.indd 47 10/4/2024 3:20:01 PM htaP A :gnitaE lufdniM ydoB yhtlaeH a ot",1509,Unknown,6,question,easy,13,0,fecu103.pdf,Science,to explore the functions

Besan or wheat flour (aata) and ghee are among the main ingredients of laddoos along with goond (edible gum), nuts, and seeds. Ghee and various kinds of oils are grouped under another kind of food component, which is called fat. Sources of fats can be from plants or animals (Fig. 3.3). Nuts, Yes, my grandma told such as groundnuts, walnuts, me that laddoos rich in coconuts, and almonds, and ghee and nuts provide energy to keep us warm. seeds, such as pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, are some sources of fat.

Polar bear Proteins are also an important part of our food. Milk products and pulses are good sources of protein. Sportspersons need proteins in larger quantities to build their muscles. People get proteins from plants as well as animals. Some excellent plant sources of protein are pulses, beans, peas and nuts (Fig. 3.4a). Animal sources of protein are milk, paneer, egg, fish and meat (Fig. 3.4b). Protein-rich foods help in growth and repair of our body. These are, therefore, called body-building foods.

Mushroom Why do you think we are advised to include servings of fruits, vegetables and other plant-based foods in our daily diet? Let us understand the importance of some other food components by reading the following two cases— Case 1 In earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered from bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called scurvy. What do you interpret by reading Case 1? What cures scurvy? Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy is caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this disease. Case 2 In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the human population in the Himalayan region and the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per norms of the Government of India, an effort was made to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre. 42 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 3.indd 42 10/4/2024 3:19:26 PM 6 edarG | ecneicS fo koobtxeT | ytisoiruC",1792,Unknown,6,example,easy,8,0,fecu103.pdf,Science,How have cooking practices changed What are your findings from the interviews you conducted?
fecu103_20260201_103715_8_28bc2936,"What do you infer from Case 2? You may have learnt about iodised salt through newspapers, advertisements or by reading about it on a salt packet. What does it mean? Iodised salt is simply common salt mixed with required quantities of salts of iodine. Salt farming is a traditional practice of a tribal community named Agariyas. They practice salt farming in the Little Rann of Kutch and other parts of Gujarat. For eight months, they live in the extreme heat of the desert and work very hard to get salt from seawater.

Activity 3.4: Let us conduct a survey  Study the chart given in Fig. 3.5 to explore the functions and sources of various food components. Find out more sources of vitamins and minerals. Also, understand the symptoms of the diseases caused by the lack of these food components.  Visit your neighbourhood, interact with people and find out if any individual shows the symptoms listed on the chart (an investigatory project of this kind can be taken by the students under the guidance of a teacher).  Correlate these symptoms with their diet and identify the deficiency disease(s) or disorder(s).  Suggest the possible cause(s) for the symptoms observed and changes required in the diet for improvement.  Suggest them to visit a doctor for further advice. 43 Reprint 2025-26 Chapter 3.indd 43 10/4/2024 3:19:49 PM htaP A :gnitaE lufdniM ydoB yhtlaeH a ot",1490,Unknown,6,example,easy,9,0,fecu103.pdf,Science,to explore the functions
