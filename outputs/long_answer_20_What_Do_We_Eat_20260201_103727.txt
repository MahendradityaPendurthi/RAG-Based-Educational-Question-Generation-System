1.  Explain in detail how the diverse food habits across different regions of India are influenced by various factors. Describe with examples how the traditional food items of a state are closely related to the locally grown crops and the prevailing climatic conditions. Furthermore, discuss how cultural practices and taste preferences also play a significant role in shaping the culinary landscape of a region.

2.  Analyze the importance of a 'balanced diet' for proper growth and development of the body. Describe with examples the major food components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, roughage, and water), explaining the primary function of each in maintaining a healthy body. Discuss why the nutritional requirements for a balanced diet are not the same for everyone, and how factors like age, gender, physical activity, and health status influence these requirements.

3.  Evaluate the concept of 'food miles' and its implications for both the environment and local communities. Explain in detail how reducing food miles contributes to cutting down costs and pollution during transport, supports local farmers, and helps keep food fresh and healthy. Discuss the broader benefits of consuming locally grown and plant-based food, emphasizing its positive impact on our health and the planet.

4.  Compare and contrast traditional and modern culinary practices in India. Describe with examples the significant differences in cooking and grinding methods used in the past versus those commonly employed today. Discuss the key factors, such as technological development, improved transportation, and better communication, that have led to these changes over time, and reflect on how these shifts might have impacted food preparation and consumption patterns.

5.  Describe in detail the experimental procedures to test for the presence of starch, fat, and protein in various food items. For each nutrient test, explain the specific steps involved, the chemicals or materials required (e.g., iodine solution, copper sulphate, caustic soda), and what a positive observation (like a colour change or an oily patch) indicates. Discuss why such simple tests are valuable for understanding the nutritional composition of the food we consume.

6.  Discuss the nutritional differences between 'junk food' and 'millets' (nutri-cereals), and explain why making informed food choices is crucial for health. Define junk food, outlining its typical nutritional characteristics and the potential negative health consequences of frequent consumption. Conversely, describe why millets like jowar, bajra, and ragi are considered 'nutri-cereals,' highlighting their rich content of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibres, and how they contribute significantly to a balanced diet.

7.  Analyze the journey of food "from farm to plate," using the example of making a chapati, to explain the importance of mindful eating and reducing food wastage. Explain in detail the various processes and the time and effort involved in getting food from its origin to our table. Discuss the ethical and practical reasons why we should never waste food and only take as much as we can consume, considering the resources and community efforts invested in its production.

1.  Analyze how the concepts of regional food diversity (influenced by cultivation, taste, culture, and traditions), the benefits of eating locally grown food, and the impact of food miles are interconnected. Explain in detail how a conscious effort to consume diverse, locally sourced food can lead to a healthier diet, support local economies, and contribute to environmental sustainability, providing examples from different states of India where possible.

2.  You have learned to perform simple tests for starch, fat, and protein in various food items. Describe with examples the detailed procedure for each of these three tests, including the chemicals and observations involved. Furthermore, evaluate how observing the presence of multiple nutrients in a single food item (like peanuts having both protein and fat) helps us understand the complexity of food composition and its implications for designing a truly balanced diet for different individuals.

3.  Compare and contrast the traditional and modern culinary practices in India, focusing on the tools and methods used for cooking and grinding. Discuss the significant factors (such as technological development, improved transportation, and better communication) that have driven these changes over time. Analyze how these shifts in culinary practices might have impacted not only the convenience of food preparation but also potentially the nutritional value of our food and overall dietary habits.

4.  Millets are increasingly being recognized as 'nutri-cereals' due to their numerous health benefits and ease of cultivation. Evaluate the statement, "Can eating just millets suffice for the nutritional requirements of the body?" in the context of achieving a balanced diet. Discuss in detail the specific nutritional contributions of millets (vitamins, minerals, dietary fibres) and explain how, despite their richness, a truly balanced diet still necessitates a variety of food components to meet all essential requirements for proper growth and development.

5.  The textbook suggests that "Not all delicious foods are necessarily healthy, while not all nutritious foods are always enjoyable." Analyze this statement by drawing upon your understanding of balanced diets, junk foods, and the varying nutritional requirements based on age, physical activity, and health status. Discuss how individuals, especially children, can make informed food choices that balance taste preferences with nutritional needs, providing examples of both healthy and unhealthy food options and their respective impacts.

6.  The journey of food from 'farm to plate' involves several critical steps, each with potential for food wastage and significant food miles. Explain in detail the various processes involved in getting a food item like wheat flour from the farm to your plate, as illustrated in Figure 3.10, and identify at least three distinct points where food wastage could occur. Based on this understanding, propose a comprehensive action plan for a school community (including students, teachers, and parents) to collectively reduce food wastage and minimize food miles, outlining specific strategies and their expected benefits.
